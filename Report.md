# Colaboration and Competition - Tennis Project

## Introduction 

The evironment consists of two agents with rackets bouncing a ball over a net. If an agent hits a ball over a net it recieves +0.1 points. If an agents lets the ball hit the ground or go out of bounds, it recieves a reward of -0.1. The goal of both agents is to keep the ball in play. 

The environment uses the tennis unity enginer environment with 24 states between the 2 agents.  Each agent recives its own local observation.  Each agent can move toward or away the net and jumping. 

In order to solve the environment the agents must achieve an average score of +0.5 over 100 consecutive episodes. 

The training and environment simulations occured on a cpu with the pc running windows.
